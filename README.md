This repository contains the code related to an optional project of the course "Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control" by Prof Raffaello D'Andrea at ETH. I wrote this code with Simone Nascivera for a class competition and we ranked 6th.

Task description available in ./DPOC_2022_PE_Instructions.pdf. 
Run the "main" script to compute and visualize the solution.
